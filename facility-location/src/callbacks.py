class Callback:
    """
    Callback class for implementing Benders' decomposition optimality cuts in the
    Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP). This class is designed to interface
    with the Gurobi optimizer and is invoked during the Mixed-Integer Programming
    (MIP) solution process. The class method is called at MIPSOL (MIP solution) callback
    events to assess newly found integer feasible solutions and to inject lazy optimality
    cuts as needed. These cuts are used to refine the solution space and guide the solver
    towards optimality by eliminating sub-optimal solutions.
