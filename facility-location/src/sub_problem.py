    Solve the subproblem for the Facility Location Problem (FLP).

    This function defines and optimizes the subproblem given the facility open decisions.
    It calculates the optimal shipment quantities from facilities to customers minimizing
    the total shipment costs while satisfying demand and capacity constraints.

    Args:
        dat (Data): The input data containing costs, demands, and capacities.
        facility_open (tupledict): A dictionary with facility indices as keys and binary
                                   decisions (1 if open, 0 if closed) as values.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the objective value, dual values for demand constraints
               (mu), and dual values for capacity constraints (nu).
